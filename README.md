# Telegram ChatGPT4 bot

- Little experiment in using microsoft guidance library to create a telegram search enabled bot.
- Can search the web, and load + urls for more details.

- Whitelisted users only - not in channel or anything like that.
- Consider it alpha.
- Can use tools/using guidance MS package.

TODO:

- Tool usage guides should be integrated into the prompt in a generic way.
